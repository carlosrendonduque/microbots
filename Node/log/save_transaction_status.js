//Set and log the transaction's status along with extra log fields. 
//There can be three possible statuses: Success, Business Exception and System Exception.
//Business Rule Exception characterizes an irregular situation according to the process's rules 
//and prevents the transaction to be processed. 
//The transaction is not retried in this case, 
//since the result will be the same until the problem that causes the exception is solved.
//For example, it can be considered a BusinessRuleException if a process expects to read an email's attachment, 
//but the sender didn't attach any file. 
//In this case, immediate retries of the transaction will not yield a different result.
//On the other hand, system exceptions are characterized by exceptions whose types are different than BusinessRuleException. 
//When this kind of exception happens, 
//the transaction item can be retried after closing and reopening the applications involved in the process. 
//The rationale behind this is that the exception was caused by a problem in the applications, 
//which might be solved by restarting them.
//If Orchestrator queues are the source of transactions, the Set Transaction Status activity is used to update the status. 
//In addition, the retry mechanism is also implemented by Orchestrator.
//If Orchestrator queues are not used, the status can be set, for example, by writing to a specific column in a spreadsheet. 
//In such cases, the retry mechanism is covered by the framework and the number of retries is defined in the configuration file.
//At the end, io_TransactionNumber is incremented, which makes the framework get the next transaction to be processed.
